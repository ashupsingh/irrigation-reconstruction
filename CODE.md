# Source entry points

Runnable new implementation: `reconstruction/model.py`; checks: `reconstruction/test_model.py`. Hardware implementation: `reconstruction/firmware/firmware.ino`. Read `CIRCUIT.md` before use.

## Earlier design notes

# Code and implementation record

## Original source status

Historical portfolio description only; original source, measurements and photographs not supplied.

No original code recovered for this project. Exact pin maps, libraries, timings and circuit values are intentionally not invented.

## Reconstructed pseudocode

This is newly written explanatory pseudocode, not executable firmware and not historical evidence.

```text
if sample invalid: pump off
else if timeout: pump off and fault
else apply start/stop hysteresis
log transitions
```

## What is needed before implementation

Confirm actual hardware/software interfaces, units, validation rules and failure states. Follow the separate methodology and its test plan. Pinout, pump current and thresholds are unverified. Demonstrate logic with simulated inputs before hardware use.
